## BPH toolbox

This repository contains useful code and modules for performing data analysis in (but not limited to) B-physics at CMS. So far this is a ```DataExplorer()``` class, which was conceived to simplify the daily fit & plot & do_some_statistics routine. Hopefully, some new modules will be developed in the future.  
The usage of '''DataExplorer()''' is illustrated in the ```tutorial.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook or in the ```test.py``` script.  
The latest release is v0.1 (see the corresponding tag).

### Required packages

The code was written and tested with the versions of the following required packages:

ROOT: 6.14/04
RooFit: 3.60
python: 3.6.8
scipy: 1.2.0
